    "- Different models of data streams exist that take different approaches with respect to the mutability of the stream and to the structure of stream elements\n",
    "- Stream processing refers to analyzing data streams on-the-ﬂy to produce new results as new input data becomes available.\n",
    "- Time is a central concept in stream processing: in almost all models of streams, each stream element is associated with one or more timestamps from a given time domain that might indicate,for instance, when the element was generated,the validity of its content, or when it became available for processing."

    "Stream processing has been an active research field for more than 20 years, but it is now witnessing its prime time due to recent successful efforts by the research community and numerous worldwide open-source communities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental aspects of stream processing systems and their evolution in the functional areas of out-of-order data management, state management, fault tolerance, high availability, load management, elasticity, and reconfiguration. We review noteworthy past research findings, outline the similarities and differences between early ('00-'10) and modern ('11-'18) streaming systems, and discuss recent trends and open problems.\n",
