    "- **Systems fail**: Networks fail, disks fail, software crashes, people make mistakes.\n",
    "- **Data access exceeds capacity to consume**: Data sources can outpace part of the processing or delivery chain\n",

    "- **What is noise one day becomes signal the next**: Priorities of an organization change - rapidly. Enabling new flows and changing existing ones must be fast.\n",
    "- **Systems evolve at different rates**: Protocols/formats can change anytime irrespective of the systems around them. Dataflow connect components that are *loosely* or *not-at-all designed* to work together.\n",
    "- **Compliance and security**: Laws, regulations, and policies change. Business to business agreements change. System to system and system to user interactions must be secure, trusted, accountable.\n",
